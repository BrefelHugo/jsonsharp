The mono project files are built using monodevelop, a free GNOME 
development environment for Mono. monodevelop can be downloaded for free 
at http://www.monodevelop.com.

monodevelop projects do not work with files outside the project 
directory. In order to share source files, the monodevelop project files 
here are built using a symbolic link to the src directory.

If your unfamiliar, enter the following after cwd to /mono:
ln -s ./../src/ src
