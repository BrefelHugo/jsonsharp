= Release 1.1 =

Release 1.1 is marked by the addition of the JSONReflector class.  JSONReflector accepts an instance of any object and uses standard reflection routines to generate a JSON object.

JSONReflector has initially been constructed to generate JSON objects from both value and reference object types, but is constrained to value-type public properties.  Generics aren't yet supported, though we expect to add those in the future.

An example application is included in the source code as well as the zip downloads.
