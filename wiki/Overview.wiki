=Overview=

JSONSharp is a C# library for constructing JSON-compliant data strings.  It's lightweight and object-oriented, using a set of abstract classes to separate data from implementation. The library was created out of a need for a generic and flexible way to generate JSON from a server-side .Net application.


==Structure==
JSONSharp objects have two jobs: (1) accept/hold data values, and (2) write them as JSON-compliant strings.

The base object of JSONSharp is the JSONValue.  Everything in JSONSharp inherits from JSONValue.  JSONValue is an 
abstract class, requiring implementors to override two methods: ToString() and PrettyPrint().
